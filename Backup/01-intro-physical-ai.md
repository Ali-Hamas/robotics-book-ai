# Introduction to Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence refers to the concept that an intelligent agent's physical body and its interactions with the environment are crucial for the development of its cognitive abilities. Instead of viewing intelligence as purely abstract and disembodied, embodied intelligence emphasizes the role of sensory-motor experiences in shaping how an agent perceives, understands, and acts within its world.

### Key Aspects of Embodied Intelligence:

*   **Physical Interaction**: Learning through direct manipulation and exploration of the environment.
*   **Sensory-Motor Coupling**: The tight coupling between perception and action, where actions influence what is perceived, and perceptions guide subsequent actions.
*   **Situatedness**: Intelligence is not abstract but situated within a specific physical and social context.
*   **Emergent Behavior**: Complex behaviors and cognitive capabilities emerge from the interaction of a simple body with a complex environment.

In robotics, embodied intelligence suggests that designing robots with appropriate physical forms and sensory capabilities, and allowing them to learn through interaction, can lead to more robust and adaptable intelligent systems. -->
