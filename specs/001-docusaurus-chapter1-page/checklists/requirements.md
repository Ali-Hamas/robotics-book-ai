# Specification Quality Checklist: Docusaurus Page for Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-30
**Feature**: [D:/RoboticsBook/specs/001-docusaurus-chapter1-page/spec.md](D:/RoboticsBook/specs/001-docusaurus-chapter1-page/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- The spec lacks an explicit "Assumptions" or "Dependencies" section. This should be added for clarity.
